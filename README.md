A simple CMS called Simple Static Site Sytem.

# Notes
At the heart of the current prototype system there is a capital sin: I have written my own HTML parser and stringifier.
I couldn't find an existing solution that meets all of my needs. If anyone knows of anything lightweight, simple, and compatible with my use case, please let me know!
